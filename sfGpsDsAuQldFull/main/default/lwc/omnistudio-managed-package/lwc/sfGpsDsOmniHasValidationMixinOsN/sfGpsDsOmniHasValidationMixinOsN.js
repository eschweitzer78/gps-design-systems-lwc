       *
       * We follow a different approach compared to OmniStudio original code which
       * sets custom validity, reports validity so it has a visual representation and
       * then attaches an event listener on the template for a focusout.
       *
       * That wasn't too good as more often than no a user would change the offending
       * value by keyboard or click without triggering a blur/focusout (with still the
       * custom validation having that visual effect... and then they hit
       * the next button.
       *
       * This would trigger a focusout and a call to the listener, clearing the custom
       * validation, reporting validity again, which would remove the graphical cues
       * for the error.
       *
       * Standard omnistudio had almost no change in size of the element in both valid and
       * invalid states, but if you come up with a different template and there are more
       * important variations, chances are it will lead to the cancellation of the click
       * event on the button as it moved away. Bummer.
       *
       * So our approach is actually to have elements systematically clear their custom
       * validation when they're interacted with, i.e. key or click so that if they're
       * otherwise valid, any error graphical cues would be removed right then, way before
       * the user has a change to move the mouse point and click on next.
       *
       * Note that the issue did not occur when users navigated away from the element
       * with the keyboard as focus out was eventually generated.
       *
       * We do it automatically for keyup as it's part of the OmniscriptValidation mixin
       * but when it comes to the change event, it's up to this mixin's base classes
       * to call setCustomValidation("") when dealing with a change, same with blur etc.
