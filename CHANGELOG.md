## 30 Nov 2022

We introduced the following items:

### NSW DS List Item

Refer to `sfGpsDsAuNsw/main/default/lwc/sfGpsDsAuNswListItem`.

This is the base object that implements the NSW Design System List Item widget.

As such it is supposed to be used in a composite object along with a Results bar and Pagination, and not really meant to be used stand-alone in a community. We however made a Community compatible variant available for demonstration purposes.

### NSW DS Pagination

Refer to `sfGpsDsAuNsw/main/default/lwc/sfGpsDsAuNswPagination`.

This is the base object that implements the NSW Design System Pagination widget.

As such it is supposed to be used in a composite object along with a Results bar and List Items, and not really meant to be used stand-alone in a community. We however made a Community compatible variant available for demonstration purposes.

### NSW DS Results bar

Refer to `sfGpsDsAuNsw/main/default/lwc/sfGpsDsAuNswResultsBar`.

This is the base object that implements the NSW Design System Results bar widget.

As such it is supposed to be used in a composite object along with a Pagination and List Items, and not really meant to be used stand-alone in a community. We however made a Community compatible variant available for demonstration purposes.

### NSW Card Managed Content Type

Refer to `sfGpsDsAuNsw/main/default/managedContentTypes/sfGpsDsAuNswCard`.

While you would normally map content in whichever format you have in the CMS to the NSW DS Card using an integration procedure, we have conveniently introduced a type that aligns 1-to-1 with the attributes of the card for demo purposes.

### NSW Content Block Managed Content Type

Refer to `sfGpsDsAuNsw/main/default/managedContentTypes/sfGpsDsAuNswCard`.

While you would normally map content in whichever format you have in the CMS to the NSW DS Content Block using an integration procedure, we have conveniently introduced a type that aligns 1-to-1 with the attributes of the content block for demo purposes.
