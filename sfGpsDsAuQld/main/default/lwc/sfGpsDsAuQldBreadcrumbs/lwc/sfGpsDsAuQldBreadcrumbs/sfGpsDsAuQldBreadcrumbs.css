/* This addresses what seems to be a bug or transient issue while the QLD Design System is actively developed:
  qld__link-list--inline has recently been setup as display flex nowrap, which means that the breadcrumb will
  never span over multiple lines as the overflow logic expects it.
  
  To circumvent this, we allow wrapping
