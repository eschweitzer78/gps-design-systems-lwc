## Support

While the contributors will do their best effort to help and correct any issue reported, there is no formal or informal commitment of doing so and no warranty regarding timelines.

In the spirit of open-source, you and your team may ultimately require to address
issues, diagnosing and fixing them as necessary. Fixes should be contributed back as outlined in our [contribution](./CONTRIBUTION.md) guidelines but care should be taken not to introduce specificities or dependencies that are unique to your operating environment. While we are looking forward to seeing your work included, we reserve the right to ask for variations or amendments or to forego contributions altogether.

Please do _not_ start using any elements of this library for other purposes than evaluation or education or consider production use if you do not have a support model in place
and adequate skills to operate. Feel free to seek advice from us on the matter.
